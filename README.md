# Coders_Assemble

## Team Profile Generator

## Introduction
    The program was designed to generate a team of coders by answering prompts about the Managers, Engineer, or Intern involved.  The information gathered is then rendered onto an HTML page that display's your team in a clean manner.

## Installation
    Since this isn't deployed in your terminal all you would need to do to use this is to run it using "node index.js" and you will be prompted in your terminal.
